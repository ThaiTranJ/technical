WebRTC stands for "Web Real-Time Communication," and it is an open-source technology and set of protocols and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable real-time communication over the internet. WebRTC is built into web browsers, making it possible to establish peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing directly between web browsers without the need for plugins or third-party software.

Key features and components of WebRTC include:

1. **Audio and Video Communication:** WebRTC allows for real-time audio and video communication between browsers. This is commonly used for video conferencing, voice calls, and live streaming applications.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer communication between browsers, reducing latency and the need for intermediaries. This is achieved through a protocol called ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment), which helps establish the most efficient connection path.

3. **Data Channel:** In addition to audio and video, WebRTC includes a data channel that allows browsers to exchange arbitrary data directly. This is useful for applications like file sharing, online gaming, and collaborative editing.

4. **Security:** WebRTC includes built-in security features, such as encryption of data during transit. This ensures that communications are secure and private.

5. **Cross-Platform:** WebRTC is supported by major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it a cross-platform technology.

6. **NAT Traversal:** WebRTC handles Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal, which is crucial for establishing direct connections between devices behind routers and firewalls.

7. **Adaptive Bitrate:** WebRTC has mechanisms for adapting audio and video quality in real-time based on network conditions. This helps maintain a smooth communication experience even when network conditions fluctuate.

WebRTC is widely used for various real-time communication applications, including:

- **Video Conferencing:** Services like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams use WebRTC to enable video conferencing features in web browsers.

- **Voice over IP (VoIP):** WebRTC is used in many VoIP applications and services to provide browser-based voice calls.

- **Live Streaming:** WebRTC is utilized for low-latency live streaming of video and audio content over the web.

- **Online Gaming:** Some online multiplayer games use WebRTC for real-time data communication between players.

- **IoT (Internet of Things):** WebRTC can be used for real-time communication between IoT devices, facilitating applications like remote control and monitoring.

WebRTC has become a fundamental technology for enabling real-time communication on the web, and its flexibility and cross-browser support have made it a popular choice for developers building interactive web applications.
