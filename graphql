GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing those queries by specifying the shape of the response. It was developed by Facebook and released as an open-source project in 2015. GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API.

Here are some key aspects of GraphQL:

1. **Declarative Data Fetching:** With GraphQL, clients can request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. This is in contrast to REST APIs, where endpoints often return fixed sets of data.

2. **Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST, which typically involves multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL has a single endpoint. Clients send queries to this endpoint to fetch the data they require.

3. **Strongly Typed:** GraphQL APIs are strongly typed, meaning the schema defines the types of data that can be queried. Clients can introspect the schema to understand the available data and its structure.

4. **Hierarchical Structure:** GraphQL queries follow a hierarchical structure that mirrors the shape of the response. This makes it easy for clients to understand and request nested data.

5. **Real-time Data:** GraphQL supports real-time data with subscriptions. Clients can subscribe to specific events and receive updates when relevant data changes.

6. **Batching:** GraphQL allows multiple queries to be batched into a single request, reducing the overhead of multiple round trips.

7. **Versionless:** Unlike REST, where changes to the API often require versioning, GraphQL allows for backward-compatible changes to the schema. New fields can be added without breaking existing clients.

8. **Security:** GraphQL provides fine-grained control over what data can be accessed. You can define custom resolvers and authorization logic to restrict access to sensitive data.

GraphQL is particularly popular for mobile and web applications because it allows frontend developers to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. It also simplifies the process of aggregating data from multiple sources, as you can fetch related data in a single query.

To use GraphQL, you typically define a schema that outlines the types and queries your API supports, and then you implement resolvers to fetch the data from your data sources. Clients send queries to the GraphQL server, specifying the fields they want, and the server responds with the requested data in the same shape as the query. This flexibility and efficiency have made GraphQL a compelling choice for many modern API implementations.
