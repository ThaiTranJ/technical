A RESTful API, or Representational State Transfer API, is a type of web API (Application Programming Interface) that adheres to the principles and constraints of the REST architectural style. REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, and it was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. RESTful APIs are commonly used for building web services and web applications.

Here are some key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs:

1. **Statelessness:** Each HTTP request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not maintain any client state between requests. This means that each request must be self-contained and include any necessary authentication or session information.

2. **Resources:** In a RESTful API, resources are the central abstractions. Resources can represent objects, data, or entities, and they are typically identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). For example, in a RESTful API for a bookstore, books, authors, and categories could be represented as resources.

3. **HTTP Methods:** RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform actions on resources. For example, a GET request is used to retrieve data, a POST request is used to create new resources, a PUT request is used to update existing resources, and a DELETE request is used to remove resources.

4. **Uniform Interface:** RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which means that the same HTTP methods and status codes are used for all resources. This simplifies the API and makes it easier to understand and use.

5. **Representation:** Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can specify their preferred representation using HTTP headers (e.g., "Accept: application/json").

6. **Stateless Communication:** Communication between the client and server is stateless. Each request/response cycle is independent, and the server does not retain any information about previous requests from the same client.

7. **Layered System:** RESTful systems can be built in a layered architecture, where different components (e.g., load balancers, caches) are added between the client and server without affecting the overall system behavior.

8. **Client-Server:** REST separates the concerns of the client and server. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and maintaining data.

RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services because of their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP protocol. They are commonly used for data retrieval, manipulation, and integration in web and mobile applications. RESTful APIs have become the standard for many web-based services and are supported by a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.
